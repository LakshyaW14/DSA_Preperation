# Hard Array Problems 

## 01 -> 3 Sum : Find triplets that add up to a zero

Problem Statement: Given an array of N integers, your task is to find unique triplets that add up to give a sum of zero. In short, you need to return an array of all the unique triplets [arr[a], arr[b], arr[c]] such that i!=j, j!=k, k!=i, and their sum is equal to zero.

Pre-requisite: 2 Sum Problem

## 02 -> 4 Sum | Find Quads that add up to a target value

Problem Statement: Given an array of N integers, your task is to find unique quads that add up to give a target value. In short, you need to return an array of all the unique quadruplets [arr[a], arr[b], arr[c], arr[d]] such that their sum is equal to a given target.

Note: a, b, c and d are also distinct and lies between 0 to n-1 (both inclusive).

## 03 -> Majority Elements -2 (&gt;N/3 times) | Find the elements that appears more than N/3 times in the array


Problem Statement: Given an integer array nums of size n. Return all elements which appear more than n/3 times in the array. The output can be returned in any order.

Examples
Example 1:
Input:
 nums = [1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2]  
Output:
 [1]  
Explanation:
 Here, n / 3 = 6 / 3 = 2.  
Therefore, the elements appearing 3 or more times are: [1].


## 04 -> Count Reverse Pairs

Problem Statement: Given an array of numbers, you need to return the count of reverse pairs. Reverse Pairs are those pairs where i<j and arr[i]>2*arr[j].

Examples
Example 1:
Input:
 N = 5, array[] = {1,3,2,3,1)
Output
: 2 
Explanation:
 The pairs are (3, 1) and (3, 1) as from both the pairs the condition arr[i] > 2*arr[j] is satisfied.


## 05 -> Pascal's triangle

Problem Statement: Write a program to generate Pascal's triangle. In Pascal’s triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it as shown in the figure below:

Input: N = 5, r = 5, c = 3 
Output: Element at position (r, c): 6
N-th row of Pascal’s triangle: 1 4 6 4 1
First n rows of Pascal’s triangle:
1 
1 1 
1 2 1 
1 3 3 1 
1 4 6 4 1  
Explanation: Pascal triangle for first 5 rows is shown above.

## 06 -> Count inversions in an array


Problem Statement: Given an array of N integers, count the inversion of the array (using merge-sort).

Inversion of an array: for all i & j < size of array, if i < j then you have to find pair (A[i],A[j]) such that A[j] < A[i].

Examples
Example 1:
Input Format: N = 5, array[] = {1,2,3,4,5}
Result: 0
Explanation: we have a sorted array and the sorted array has 0 inversions as for i < j you will never find a pair such that A[j] < A[i]. More clear example: 2 has index 1 and 5 has index 4 now 1 < 5 but 2 < 5 so this is not an inversion.
